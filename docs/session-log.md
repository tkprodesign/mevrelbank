# Agent Session Log — MevrelBank

> **Purpose:** A precise, continuously updated record of every agent session on this repository. Each entry documents the session date, the GitHub PR it produced, every file touched, exact line-count deltas, and a clear statement of what changed and why.
>
> **Update protocol:** This file must be updated at the end of every agent session. New entries are appended at the top (most-recent first). The pre-session baseline state is recorded once at the bottom.

## S-11 · 2026-07-10T03:30Z · GitHub Sync Engine v1

**Agent:** Copilot Coding Agent
**Branch:** `work`
**PR:** (current)
**Trigger:** User request to add production-quality GitHub Sync Engine v1 infrastructure for syncing this repository to `codywoods8899/mevrelbank`.

### Objective
Create reusable synchronization infrastructure that reads target settings from configuration, compares branch HEAD SHAs, pushes only the current branch when needed, and prevents sync loops with actor, marker, and SHA guards. Do not modify application code.

### Files Changed
| File | Status | +Lines | −Lines | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| `.github/sync-config.json` | added | 5 | 0 | Target owner, repo, and default branch configuration for the sync engine |
| `.github/workflows/sync-engine.yml` | added | 190 | 0 | Production GitHub Actions sync engine with full-history checkout, target clone, SHA comparison, branch-only push, strict bash, and logging |
| `.github/workflows/sync-to-cody.yml` | removed | 0 | 32 | Removed old simple push workflow to avoid duplicate synchronization paths |
| `docs/github-sync-engine.md` | added | 120 | 0 | Architecture, loop prevention, configuration, secrets, disablement, logging, and troubleshooting docs |
| `docs/session-log.md` | modified | ~24 | 0 | Recorded this infrastructure session per repository agent documentation rules |

### Outcome
GitHub Sync Engine v1 is ready for use once `SYNC_PAT` is configured. The old one-off sync workflow was removed so synchronization is handled by the reusable engine only.

## S-10 · 2026-07-10T01:52Z · Cloudflare D1 waitlist backend

**Agent:** Copilot Coding Agent  
**Branch:** `copilot/fix-1-let-us-use-cloudflare-d1` (current session branch)  
**PR:** (current)  
**Trigger:** User request to use Cloudflare D1 as the site database, starting with the waitlist form.

### Objective
Replace the `mailto:` waitlist submission with a real database-backed endpoint using Cloudflare D1 and Cloudflare Pages Functions. No separate Workers project — Pages Functions handle the API layer natively via a `functions/` directory.

### Files Changed
| File | Status | +Lines | −Lines | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| `wrangler.toml` | added | 8 | 0 | Cloudflare Pages project name + D1 binding (`DB` → `mevrelbank-db`) |
| `migrations/0001_waitlist.sql` | added | 12 | 0 | Creates `waitlist_submissions` table + `created_at` index |
| `functions/api/waitlist.ts` | added | 104 | 0 | `POST /api/waitlist` — validates input, inserts to D1; CORS + `OPTIONS` handler |
| `src/app/website/pages/WaitlistPage.tsx` | modified | +24 | −15 | Replaced `mailto:` logic with `fetch("/api/waitlist")`; added loading + error states |
| `README.md` | modified | +40 | 0 | Added Cloudflare D1 setup, migration, and binding instructions |

### API contract
- `POST /api/waitlist` accepts JSON `{ name, email, accountType, message? }`
- Validates all required fields server-side; length-limits name (120), email (254), message (2000)
- Inserts into `waitlist_submissions` (D1 SQLite)
- CORS allowed for: `mevrelbank.com`, `www.mevrelbank.com`, `localhost:5173`, and any `*.pages.dev` preview URL

### Outcome
Waitlist submissions are now stored in Cloudflare D1. The `mailto:` fallback has been removed. Inline error and loading states added to the form. The `wrangler.toml` `database_id` placeholder must be replaced with the real ID after running `wrangler d1 create mevrelbank-db`.

## S-09 · 2026-07-10T01:40Z · Phase 2 auth pages scaffold

**Agent:** Copilot Coding Agent  
**Branch:** (part of Phase 2 auth work, committed directly to current branch at `b112c5a`)  
**Trigger:** User request to scaffold all Phase 2 authentication pages.

### Objective
Build all six authentication page routes using a shared `AuthShell` layout component — a centered card layout without the full Navbar/Footer, suitable for login/register flows.

### Files Changed
| File | Status | +Lines | −Lines | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| `src/app/website/components/AuthShell.tsx` | added | 116 | 0 | Shared auth layout: logo bar, centered card, minimal footer |
| `src/app/website/pages/LoginPage.tsx` | added | 119 | 0 | Email + password, show/hide toggle, error state, forgot/register links |
| `src/app/website/pages/RegisterPage.tsx` | added | 274 | 0 | Name, email, password strength, account type, T&C acceptance |
| `src/app/website/pages/VerifyEmailPage.tsx` | added | 206 | 0 | 6-digit OTP input grid, paste support, resend countdown |
| `src/app/website/pages/ForgotPasswordPage.tsx` | added | 111 | 0 | Email input, success/inbox state |
| `src/app/website/pages/ResetPasswordPage.tsx` | added | 160 | 0 | New password form, strength indicator, success state |
| `src/app/website/pages/MFAPage.tsx` | added | 205 | 0 | TOTP input, SMS fallback toggle, resend countdown |
| `src/app/website/pages/index.tsx` | modified | 7 | 0 | Barrel export updated with all auth pages |
| `src/main.tsx` | modified | +15 | 0 | 6 new routes: `/login`, `/register`, `/verify-email`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`, `/mfa` |
| `mevrelbank/roadmap.md` | modified | +11 | −1 | Phase 2 auth items checked off |
| `dist/` | rebuilt | — | — | New bundle |

**Total net new source lines:** ~1,197

### Route table after this session
| Path | Component |
|------|-----------|
| `/login` | `LoginPage` |
| `/register` | `RegisterPage` |
| `/verify-email` | `VerifyEmailPage` |
| `/forgot-password` | `ForgotPasswordPage` |
| `/reset-password` | `ResetPasswordPage` |
| `/mfa` | `MFAPage` |

### Outcome
All Phase 2 UI pages scaffolded. These are fully functional frontend forms with proper UX states but no backend integration yet — that remains Phase 2 backend work (JWT, email service, TOTP provisioning).

## S-08 · 2026-07-10 · Phase 1 close-out: waitlist page, SEO baseline, roadmap sync

**Branch:** `copilot/fix-s8-phase1-closeout` (current session branch)  
**PR:** (current)  
**Trigger:** User request to close out Phase 1: update roadmap, replace mailto CTAs with a real waitlist page, and add per-route SEO metadata.

### Objective
Three deliverables:
1. Sync `mevrelbank/roadmap.md` — mark all 7 Phase 1 inner pages as complete; add remaining Phase 1 work items.
2. Waitlist / lead capture — replace all "Open Account" `mailto:` CTAs with a proper `/waitlist` route that collects name, email, and account type before opening the email client.
3. SEO baseline — add a dependency-free `PageMeta` component that sets `document.title` and `<meta name="description">` per route on every page.

### Files Changed
| File | Status | +Lines | −Lines | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| `mevrelbank/roadmap.md` | modified | 3 | 7 | 7 inner pages checked off; 3 remaining Phase 1 items added |
| `src/app/website/components/PageMeta.tsx` | added | 22 | 0 | `useEffect`-based title + meta description setter; zero new dependencies |
| `src/app/website/pages/WaitlistPage.tsx` | added | ~170 | 0 | Personal/business radio selector, mailto form, submitted state, what-happens-next aside |
| `src/app/website/pages/index.tsx` | modified | 1 | 0 | Export `WaitlistPage` |
| `src/main.tsx` | modified | 2 | 1 | Import + `/waitlist` route added |
| `src/app/website/components/Hero.tsx` | modified | 1 | 1 | "Open a Free Account" → `/waitlist` |
| `src/app/website/components/CTA.tsx` | modified | 2 | 2 | "Open a Free Account" → `/waitlist`; "Explore Business Accounts" `#business` → `/products#business` |
| `src/app/website/components/Navbar.tsx` | modified | 2 | 2 | "Open Account" → `/waitlist` (desktop + mobile) |
| `src/app/website/pages/AboutPage.tsx` | modified | 7 | 1 | Import + `<PageMeta>` added; fragment wrapper |
| `src/app/website/pages/BlogPage.tsx` | modified | 7 | 1 | Import + `<PageMeta>` added; fragment wrapper |
| `src/app/website/pages/CareersPage.tsx` | modified | 7 | 1 | Import + `<PageMeta>` added; fragment wrapper |
| `src/app/website/pages/ContactPage.tsx` | modified | 7 | 1 | Import + `<PageMeta>` added; fragment wrapper |
| `src/app/website/pages/FaqsPage.tsx` | modified | 7 | 1 | Import + `<PageMeta>` added; fragment wrapper |
| `src/app/website/pages/HomePage.tsx` | modified | 5 | 0 | Import + `<PageMeta>` added inline |
| `src/app/website/pages/ProductsPage.tsx` | modified | 8 | 2 | Import + `<PageMeta>` added; primaryCta → `/waitlist`; fragment wrapper |
| `src/app/website/pages/SecurityPage.tsx` | modified | 7 | 1 | Import + `<PageMeta>` added; fragment wrapper |
| `dist/` | rebuilt | — | — | New bundle after source changes |

**Total net new source lines:** ~+248

### Per-route SEO data
| Route | `<title>` | `<meta description>` (≤160 chars) |
|-------|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| `/` | MevrelBank — Smarter Banking for a Modern Life | MevrelBank brings clarity, speed, and intelligence to your finances. A modern digital banking platform built for the way you live. |
| `/about` | About MevrelBank — Mission, Vision & Values | Learn about MevrelBank, the digital banking platform built around trust, speed, and clarity. Discover our mission, values, and team focus areas. |
| `/products` | Products & Services — MevrelBank | Explore MevrelBank's core banking products: personal accounts, savings, business banking, payments, cards, and international transfers. |
| `/contact` | Contact MevrelBank — Get in Touch | Reach out to the MevrelBank team for product enquiries, support, partnerships, or press contacts. Multiple contact channels available. |
| `/faqs` | FAQs — MevrelBank | Answers to the most common questions about MevrelBank: account types, security, business banking, and how to register interest. |
| `/security-center` | Security Center — MevrelBank | MevrelBank is designed with a security-first posture. Learn about our security practices and responsible disclosure process. |
| `/careers` | Careers at MevrelBank — Join the Team | Explore career opportunities at MevrelBank. We value high ownership, thoughtful craft, and low-ego execution. |
| `/blog` | MevrelBank Blog — Updates & Perspectives | Stay up to date with product updates, company news, and security communications from the MevrelBank team. |
| `/waitlist` | Join the Waitlist — MevrelBank | Register your interest in MevrelBank personal or business banking. Be among the first to know when accounts are available. |

### CTA audit post-session
All "Open Account" and "Open a Free Account" buttons across the site now point to `/waitlist`. The security reporting `mailto:security@mevrelbank.com` CTA in `SecurityPage` and the contact form `mailto:` in `ContactPage` are intentionally preserved — these are appropriate direct email channels, not conversion CTAs.

### Outcome
Phase 1 is now structurally complete: 9 routed pages, all with unique titles and meta descriptions, all primary conversion CTAs routing through a dedicated waitlist page. The roadmap reflects this. Next logical step is Phase 2 (Authentication) or continued Phase 1 polish (Blog content, legal pages).

## S-07 · 2026-07-10 · This session log

**Branch:** `copilot/create-session-log`  
**PR:** (current)  
**Trigger:** User request — create a scientifically precise, retroactively complete agent session log and commit it to the repository.

### Objective
Create `docs/session-log.md` as a living document that records every agent session with file-level precision. Reconstruct all six prior sessions from the GitHub PR and commit history since no log existed before.

### Method
1. Retrieved all 6 merged PRs via GitHub MCP (`list_pull_requests`).
2. Retrieved file-level diffs for each PR via `get_files` on each pull request number.
3. Retrieved git log and PR descriptions for timing and context.
4. Cross-referenced with stored agent memories and `mevrelbank/roadmap.md`.

### Files Changed
| File | Status | +Lines | −Lines |
|------|--------|--------|--------|
| `docs/session-log.md` | added | ~250 | 0 |

### Outcome
Session log created. All prior sessions S-01 through S-06 reconstructed from PR history.

## S-06 · 2026-07-09T05:05–05:08Z · Business model + next-steps homepage section

**Branch:** `copilot/next-steps-website-business-model`  
**PR:** [#6](https://github.com/codywoods8899/mevrelbank/pull/6) — merged 2026-07-09T05:08:33Z  
**Trigger:** User request to add a business model and website next-steps section to the homepage.

### Objective
Make the homepage's purpose explicit: not just brand communication but demand validation and strategic signalling. Show visitors how MevrelBank plans to grow (three revenue pillars) and what the website should do next (three prioritised next steps).

### Files Changed (source)
| File | Status | +Lines | −Lines | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| `src/app/website/components/BusinessModel.tsx` | added | 103 | 0 | New section component |
| `src/app/website/pages/HomePage.tsx` | modified | 2 | 0 | Import + mount `<BusinessModel />` |

### Files Changed (dist rebuild)
| File | Status | +Lines | −Lines |
|------|--------|--------|--------|
| `dist/assets/index-CFGzHcFD.js` | added | 330 | 0 |
| `dist/assets/index-Dk3UZPRj.css` | added | 1 | 0 |
| `dist/assets/index-6jcR4itQ.js` | removed | 0 | 329 |
| `dist/assets/index-CHKjUH9-.css` | removed | 0 | 1 |
| `dist/index.html` | modified | 2 | 2 |

### Component Detail: `BusinessModel.tsx`
- `REVENUE_PILLARS` array (3 items): Personal banking, Business banking, Expansion services — each with a title and explanatory paragraph.
- `NEXT_STEPS` array (3 items, step 01–03): Convert interest → waitlist, Publish product + pricing detail, Strengthen trust pages.
- Section layout: `bg-[#F4F7FB]` section, 3-column pillar grid (white cards), 3-column dark-navy next-steps grid.
- Accessible: `aria-labelledby="business-model-heading"`, `<article>` elements per card, semantic heading hierarchy (h2 → h3 → h4).

### Outcome
Homepage now contains 9 distinct sections (Navbar, Hero, TrustBar, Features, AppPreview, CoreSections [×5 subsections], BusinessModel, CTA, Footer). The site functions as both a brand page and a strategy/demand-validation surface.

## S-05 · 2026-07-09T04:52–04:53Z · Phase 1 inner pages (7 routes)

**Branch:** `copilot/database-hosting-query`  
**PR:** [#5](https://github.com/codywoods8899/mevrelbank/pull/5) — merged 2026-07-09T04:53:01Z  
**Trigger:** User request to add all planned Phase 1 inner pages so the live site has real destinations beyond the homepage.

### Objective
Add routed, first-class inner pages for About, Products, Contact, FAQs, Security Center, Careers, and Blog. Standardise inner-page structure via a shared shell component. Update navigation to point to page routes rather than homepage fragment anchors.

### Files Changed
| File | Status | +Lines | −Lines | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| `src/app/website/components/PageShell.tsx` | added | 110 | 0 | Reusable inner-page layout: hero, Navbar, Footer, section spacing |
| `src/app/website/pages/AboutPage.tsx` | added | 102 | 0 | Mission, vision, values, leadership focus |
| `src/app/website/pages/BlogPage.tsx` | added | 43 | 0 | Placeholder editorial route |
| `src/app/website/pages/CareersPage.tsx` | added | 57 | 0 | Hiring posture + career interest mailto CTA |
| `src/app/website/pages/ContactPage.tsx` | added | 115 | 0 | Enquiry form (mailto payload) + support channels |
| `src/app/website/pages/FaqsPage.tsx` | added | 43 | 0 | Accordion-style FAQ answers |
| `src/app/website/pages/ProductsPage.tsx` | added | 97 | 0 | Core product categories with `#personal` / `#business` anchors |
| `src/app/website/pages/SecurityPage.tsx` | added | 68 | 0 | Security posture + responsible disclosure guidance |
| `src/app/website/pages/index.tsx` | added | 7 | 0 | Barrel export for all page components |
| `src/main.tsx` | modified | 17 | 4 | 7 new routes added to `createBrowserRouter` |
| `src/app/website/components/Footer.tsx` | modified | 16 | 22 | Links updated from `#fragment` anchors to `/page` routes |
| `src/app/website/components/Navbar.tsx` | modified | 9 | 14 | Links updated from `#fragment` anchors to `/page` routes |

**Total net lines added (source):** +684

### Route table after this session
| Path | Component |
|------|-----------|
| `/` | `HomePage` |
| `/about` | `AboutPage` |
| `/products` | `ProductsPage` |
| `/contact` | `ContactPage` |
| `/faqs` | `FaqsPage` |
| `/security-center` | `SecurityPage` |
| `/careers` | `CareersPage` |
| `/blog` | `BlogPage` |
| `/ds` | Design system demo (`App`) |

### Outcome
All Phase 1 public-site destinations are live. Navigation (Navbar + Footer) points to stable page routes. Deep-links such as `/products#personal` and `/products#business` preserved via section anchors inside `ProductsPage`.

## S-04 · 2026-07-09T03:47–03:48Z · Homepage integrity pass

**Branch:** `copilot/mevrelbank-hosting-strategy`  
**PR:** [#4](https://github.com/codywoods8899/mevrelbank/pull/4) — merged 2026-07-09T03:48:27Z  
**Trigger:** User request to fix homepage integrity: broken nav/footer anchors, unverifiable regulatory claims, and placeholder conversion endpoints.

### Objective
Close the gap between the visually complete homepage and its actual behaviour: nav links resolving to missing anchors, hero/trust-bar making unverifiable regulatory/awards claims, and CTAs looping back to `#` placeholders.

### Files Changed
| File | Status | +Lines | −Lines | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| `src/app/website/components/CoreSections.tsx` | added | 158 | 0 | New: Personal, Business, About, Careers, Support sections with real IDs |
| `src/app/website/components/Footer.tsx` | modified | 31 | 12 | Links wired to real anchors; legal copy rewritten to dev-stage language |
| `src/app/website/components/Hero.tsx` | modified | 6 | 6 | Removed `£18B+ AUM`, `99.99% uptime`, `4.9★` (unverifiable); replaced with neutral copy; CTA `href` → `mailto:` |
| `src/app/website/components/Navbar.tsx` | modified | 4 | 4 | "Log in" → `/ds`; "Open Account" → `mailto:` |
| `src/app/website/components/CTA.tsx` | modified | 6 | 5 | CTA → `mailto:hello@mevrelbank.com`; secondary → `#business`; footer legal line updated |
| `src/app/website/components/TrustBar.tsx` | modified | 5 | 5 | Replaced FSCS/FCA/ISO/Which? with neutral security-posture messaging |
| `src/app/website/pages/HomePage.tsx` | modified | 2 | 0 | Import + mount `<CoreSections />` |

**Total net lines added (source):** +189

### CoreSections detail
Five inline sections with stable `id` attributes for nav anchors: `#personal`, `#business`, `#about`, `#careers`, `#support`. Support section has three deep-link targets: `#support-contact`, `#support-security`, `#support-status`.

### Compliance rationale
All unverifiable figures and regulatory assertions were removed. Hero regulatory badge changed to `"Security-first product design"`. TrustBar replaced with factual product-posture labels. Footer legal block rewritten to reflect development-stage status. This aligns with the project's pre-launch state and avoids misleading potential customers about regulatory authorisations not yet obtained.

### Outcome
All primary navigation paths resolve to real content. Conversion endpoints use `mailto:` addresses. No unverifiable regulatory or performance claims remain on the live page.

## S-03 · 2026-07-08T19:43–19:48Z · React Router + dist build

**Branch:** `copilot/understand-project-vision`  
**PR:** [#3](https://github.com/codywoods8899/mevrelbank/pull/3) — merged 2026-07-08T19:48:29Z  
**Trigger:** User request to extract the homepage from the design system demo shell into a real, routable public website.

### Objective
The public website existed only as a tab inside the design system demo (`App.tsx`). This session added React Router v7, exposed `/` as the homepage, preserved `/ds` as the design system demo, wired brand PNGs into `public/brand/`, and produced a deployable `dist/` build.

### Context
The Figma-imported design system (committed before PR #1) already contained all website component source files: `Navbar.tsx`, `Hero.tsx`, `TrustBar.tsx`, `Features.tsx`, `AppPreview.tsx`, `CTA.tsx`, `Footer.tsx`, `shared/Logo.tsx`, `shared/Btn.tsx`. This session did not create those components; it wired them into a routed application.

### Files Changed
| File | Status | +Lines | −Lines | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| `index.html` | modified | 10 | 12 | Title updated; favicon wired to brand PNG; root div preserved |
| `dist/index.html` | added | 21 | 0 | Built entry point |
| `dist/assets/index-6jcR4itQ.js` | added | 329 | 0 | Vite bundle |
| `dist/assets/index-CHKjUH9-.css` | added | 1 | 0 | Vite CSS bundle (minified) |
| `dist/brand/mevrelbank-horizontal-logo-v1.png` | added | — | — | Binary |
| `dist/brand/mevrelbank-primary-logo-v1.png` | added | — | — | Binary |
| `dist/brand/mevrelbank-reverse-logo-v1.png` | added | — | — | Binary |
| `dist/brand/mevrelbank-symbol-favicon-v1.png` | added | — | — | Binary |
| `dist/brand/mevrelbank-symbol-logo-v1.png` | added | — | — | Binary |

> **Note:** `src/main.tsx` was updated to use `RouterProvider` (React Router v7), but this change pre-dated or was part of the base commit and does not appear in the PR diff delta. The PR description confirms routing was the core deliverable.

### Outcome
`/` → `HomePage`, `/ds` → design system demo. Brand PNGs served from `public/brand/`. Site deployable to Cloudflare Pages from the `dist/` folder. Live site subsequently confirmed reachable at `mevrelbank.com`.

## S-02 · 2026-07-08T19:34–19:48Z · Fix package-lock.json

**Branch:** `copilot/fix-sync-repository-to-dropbox`  
**PR:** [#2](https://github.com/codywoods8899/mevrelbank/pull/2) — merged 2026-07-08T19:48:42Z  
**Trigger:** CI failure — the Dropbox Sync Actions workflow (introduced in S-01) was failing at `npm ci` because `package-lock.json` was absent.

### Root cause
`actions/setup-node@v4` with `cache: npm` and `npm ci` both require a lock file. S-01 committed `package.json` but not `package-lock.json`.

### Files Changed
| File | Status | +Lines | −Lines | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| `package-lock.json` | added | 457 | 0 | Locks 34 packages; 0 known vulnerabilities at time of generation |
| `.gitignore` | added | 1 | 0 | Excludes `node_modules/` |

### Dependency snapshot (root)
| Package | Version | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `dropbox` | `^10.34.0` | Dropbox SDK |
| `node-fetch` | `^3.3.2` | HTTP client for sync scripts |

### Outcome
Workflow unblocked. `npm ci` succeeds in CI. `node_modules/` excluded from version control.

## S-01 · 2026-07-08T19:19–19:31Z · Dropbox sync system

**Branch:** `copilot/build-dropbox-sync-system`  
**PR:** [#1](https://github.com/codywoods8899/mevrelbank/pull/1) — merged 2026-07-08T19:31:55Z  
**Trigger:** User request to create a GitHub Actions workflow that synchronises the repository to Dropbox.

### Objective
Build a complete, production-grade Dropbox sync system as a GitHub Actions workflow. The system must: scan the repo for changed files, upload them to Dropbox, archive orphan Dropbox files (never delete), compare remote vs local state, and produce structured logs.

**Total net lines added:** ~1,246

### Architecture summary
- **Trigger:** `push` to `main` (via `dropbox-sync.yml`)
- **Runner:** `ubuntu-latest`, Node.js 20
- **Secrets required:** `DROPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` (Dropbox API), `DROPBOX_TARGET_FOLDER` (destination path)
- **Flow:** `scanner.js` → `compare.js` → `upload.js` + `archive.js` → `logger.js`
- **Archival:** Orphan files moved to a timestamped archive folder; never permanently deleted

### Outcome
Fully functional Dropbox sync workflow. Note: workflow was blocked in CI until S-02 added the missing `package-lock.json`.

## Pre-Session Baseline State

**Established before PR #1 (2026-07-08)**

The repository was initialised with:

| Asset | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Brand logo system | `mevrelbank/brand/` | PNG logos: horizontal, primary, reverse, symbol, favicon |
| Figma Design System v0.1.0 | `mevrelbank/design-systems/agents/figma/Figma Design System For Banking Ecosystem v0.1.0/` | Full Vite + React + Tailwind CSS v4 app including all website component source files |
| Roadmap | `mevrelbank/roadmap.md` | Phase 0–11 plan with milestones and decisions log |
| AICG gateway | `aicg/` | Node.js/Express read-only GitHub intelligence gateway |
| Replit config | `.replit`, `replit.md` | Replit workspace configuration |
| GitHub Actions stubs | `.github/scripts/*.js` | Stub scripts for Dropbox sync (pre-implementation) |

**Website components pre-existing in the Figma app:**
`Navbar.tsx`, `Hero.tsx`, `TrustBar.tsx`, `Features.tsx`, `AppPreview.tsx`, `CTA.tsx`, `Footer.tsx`, `shared/Logo.tsx`, `shared/Btn.tsx`, `pages/HomePage.tsx`, `App.tsx` (design system demo shell)

These were imported from Figma and committed as part of the initial design system import, before any agent sessions began.
